my general impression: okay questions, but the manipulation, output are too coarse to illuminate on mechanism nor provide sufficient explanatory power for reality.

## motivational question
phenomenon: increasing minority group (hispanic & asian increase a lot in recent 50 years!)
[http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/01/FT_16.01.25_NextAmerica_1965_20651.png]
"babies of color are now the majority"

## what would be people's reaction?
suggested consequence: political (partisian competition); ideology shift (policy preference)

### ideology? controlled experiment
conditions: (1) geographic mobility: people move around in the contry (2) racial shift: increase minority population (3ï¼‰ racial shift + one more paragraph about "social status likely remain same" (assuaged status threat)

output: "general conservative/liberate" self-rating...```sounds very unspecific and unreliable to me!```

### perceived discrimination
same 3 conditions. output: how likely do you think "white people"(or other group) will be discriminated today/in the future?
with or without "The assuaging status", the racial shift article increases the perceived discrimination.

yet if talk about "american identify will remain the same", no big increase. (well, the manipualtion is not that big either)

find *more direct* factors? *perceived and **actual** racial shift in a community!*

### solidarity among diff minority group
"oppressions are linked and oppressed people should work together"

manipulation: does the discrimination come from some other individual, or institutional (company, society)?
