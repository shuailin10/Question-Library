my ques:
- stats of environment in his design
- is there model-building?

key: foraging task.
what's the structure in foraging envir? what's the key variable compared to static choice task?

## accept/reject decision rather than choosing 1 btw 2.
* why it's more realistic (esp suitable in foraging task)? 
  * hardly 2 options pop up at the exact same time.
  * you can reject / accept 2 options at the same time

* difference in choice models?
  * there's a default (reject/accept). -- very like my default towards snacks!!
  * would be looking at indipendent evidence accumulations.

* brain process if doing accep/rej choice? (what to look for in recording?)
esp: the evidence accumulation trace.
possible hypotheses: 1-single trajectory for 2 items; 2-2 trajectories at the same time; 3-1 trajectory for 1 item at the same time 
argument for each hypo?
3 over 2: less cognitive/attentional load.

* behavioral paradigm
asynchronized presentation of 2 options, then choose when they are conjunctive.

## presentation modality
experienced VS described
no diff in behav, but the neuron in OFC respond very differently!
