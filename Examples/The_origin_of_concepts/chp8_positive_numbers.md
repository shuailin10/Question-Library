## Q1 (descriptive): what's the process of acquiring the concept of "positive number"?
I think: (1) counting may not be natural. It's about making very precise judgement of quantity, which may not be needed in most cases, thus is not necessary to be evolved. (2) some functions supporting positive numbers may be natural. First, need to have the concept of quantity; then, basic operations such as "bigger/smaller than" [*--correspond to "set theory"? is that people's basic cognition? what about "group theory"?*].

``
to be read back: "infants have core cognition of number: the analog magnitude and the parallel individuation systems described in chapter 4 and the set-based quantification system described in chapter 7."
``

### Define continuity or discontinuity in the learning of positive number?
+ Continuity hypothesis(Gelman and Gallisel): 
  + **discrete numeral list** infants have the innate ability to establish a non-verbal counting list (**shown by ...what? chp4? **). Then they only need to map those representation into their own language that expresses this numeron list. Thus, learning to count should be easy (*after children demonstrate the non-verbal counting ability?*)
  + **analog magnitude representation** It has been shown that both adults (*to check: chp4*) and infants have a mapping between analog magnitude representation to numeral list (mentioned above); could that also map to positive numbers?
  However, if that is the basis of natural numbers, that requires iterative, serial process to construct a magnitude representation. Yet that seems not to be the case...
  > Is the magnitude representation based on iterative "counting"? 
  
  > typical task: distinction between M and N items shown to them (eg: dots on cards), by habituation. Different from enumeration because the processing time for smaller/bigger number doesn't vary a lot, supporting a "parallel processing". -- *Chronometric studies of numerical cognition in five-month-old infants*, Wood and Spelke (2005)

**conclusion 1: counting is not necessary for some number operation**

  Other conceptual failures of analog rep (as basis of natural number rep):
  + can't represent infinitely high magnitude (*but is this generalization ability our definition of "postive number system"?? *).
  + inexact and subject to Weber fraction considerations, thus fails to capture small numerical differences between large sets of objects


+ Discontinuity hypothesis: after they are able to"use a stably ordered list and count each object just once, honoring the stable order and 1–1 correspondence principles...", it's still hard and needs the training of the culture to "figure out the cardinality principle—that is, before they figure out how counting represents number"/"learn the meaning of number words". 
> Wynn's demonstration: children are able to count (with English words such as "one, two, four, six, seven..."), i.e. able to answer **"how many toys are there?"**, but unable to use numbers to: (1) take out certain number of toys (2) to choose a card with certain number of items [--in summary, instead of mapping items to number, it's **mapping number to items**]

> In contrast, children are able to identify "one" and succeed in the tasks above if asked to distinguish "one" and anything more than one. -- so called **"one"-knowers**.

**conclusion 2: counting is not sufficient for using natural numbers in other questions**

``What I don't understand (not correspondent to my intuition and no literature referred to): "...English speakers learning French do not learn the list, going through a stage where they know that it refers to number, but take “deux,” “trois,” “quatre,” and “cinq” to be roughly synonymous with each other, meaning plural or some."
``

The discontinuity appears in the gap between "subset-knowers" to "cardinal principle knowers". Task to distinguish them:
+ "how many are there?"(after counting a pile) -- CPK would answer the last counted number, while SK may not (just give a random number or recount; they don't realize that "last word reached in a count represents the cardinal value of the set") -- **"last-word rule** needs to be established before becoming CPK.
+ "how many are there?" -- for a "two-knower", would use only "three"/"four" to describe everything larger than 2.
+ "what's on the card?" (N dots) -- SK would say "Some apples" / "M apples" but M is wrong.
--these two measurements always agree with each other! (LeCorre et al., 2006).

**In summary, the developmental trajectory:**
>They then become “two”-knowers, remaining so for several more months. They then become “three”-knowers, and some also become “four”-knowers before figuring out how the numeral list represents natural number. Children stay subset- knowers for 1 to 1 1⁄2 years.

**If counting is not sufficient for representing positive numbers...**
### What's additional that helps to construct postive number concepts?
my guess: 1) number as a description for an integrated array of things. The distinction between "elements" and "array".--this corresponds to hypo1, that children has the "set of items" - magnitude mapping - a number. 2) deducting larger numbers to map to larger magnitudes
And why is this a cultural construction?

### why bother learning to count, at all?
my guess: necessary to expand the natural number (eg: knowing that 100001 is 1 larger than 100000).

### beyond developmental study?
anthropology studies: 
> the anthropologists Daniel Everett (2005) described an isolated Amazonian culture, the Piraha, with a “one, two, many” system of quantifiers...these quantifiers are better translated with relative quantifiers (“a few,” “more than a few,” “many”), rather than as “one,” “two,” “many.” There is no evidence that the Piraha have a word in their language that expresses the concept of “one.”

## Q2 (explanatory): what's the learning mechanism that enables this acquisition?

### What's the objective of learning? (What does that mean to "learn natural number"?)
+ able to use a number ("how many are there"/"give me four apples"/...)
+ able to understand a new number concept by mapping it to suitable position on the list (eg: eleven)

### Starting point of learning process?
[learning theory] assumes that the child first learns “one, two, three, four, five ...” as a list of meaningless lexical items. This is the numeral-knower stage documented above. Then what else?

### Hypo 1: when children are able to map quantities into a magnitude representation
key test: (a) whether children have figured out the analog magnitude mapping,(b) whether they know principles such as "lastcount" represents the magnitude, or whether they can find the set with correct number
**conclusion**: turns out performance in these two tasks are not equal, ruling out the possiblity  that knowin gthe "analog manigtude mapping is a precursor for learning the natural number.

### Hypo2: learn small numbers asquantifiers in language; then using counting principles to deduct larger numbers
evidence:
- "one/a" ah sre used equivalently for "one-knowers"
- japanese / mandarin speakers learn "one-knowers" later than English/Russian speakers who has quantifiers to distinguish singular/ plural in grammar.
=> verbal quantifiers are important for acquisition of number representation
- 1 to 4  are first learnt, in par with the number of items in working memory for parallel individualization representation (how many individual "ones" are in this set?), which may be how children initially represent the meaning of "two to four"(in contrast to an analog magnitude representation, which may not be available for children at this stage)
