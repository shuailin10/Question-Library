Examples:
+ "Hot": degree of heat -> temperature and heat
+ "Fast": speed -> instantaneous and average velocity
+ "Heavy": -> mass and density

Research questions:
+ What is CS1 and CS2 (i.e. Old and new theory)?
    + What are their relation? (Here: (un)differentiated concepts)
+ how to characterize CS1 (a theory that we no longer use)?
    + What language do they use? What contexts do they use those concepts?
    + Do they have some terms that we (in CS2) never use?
    + Why does that concept work? In what scenarios is it correct?
    + What is a prototype underlying that theory? (A more basic theory...and probably another set of CS1 and CS2)
+ When does CS1 transform to CS2? What has happened?
    + Historically how did the concept change?
    + Developmentally when?

# theory of weight
##  whatis cs1 and cs2?

Cs2: mass equals density times volume; mass is an extensive quantity while density is extensive.

Cs1 seemed to assume that volume dictates mass? Let's look closer

(Their relation: undifferentiated concept of density and weight? Or just lack of conservation?)

## characterize cs1?
### Language they use?
Relative description of "heaviness".

### Do they have some terms that we (in CS2) never use?
 
Eg: unit of different matters are different.

The same thing weighs differently for different people.
### What are different judgements in CS1 holders make?
**don't agree with CS2 **
+ (judge weight by vertical length; or surface area?) When a ball of soft clay being smashed to a pancake shape, kids (~5 years old) think it weights differently / has different amount of clay / takes up different amount of space. (Piaget & Inhelder 1974)
+ (judge weight by vertical length) Kids (5~6 yr old) think a vertical triangle weights less when it is turned on its side (??)
+ (judge quantity by vertical length; different measures of quantity not yet established) Kids (aged 5-6) think juice in a thinner taller glass is more, even after they've seen 3 times as much(?? How was that defined) juice is poured in the low wide glass; and some kids fail to notice the contradiction that the juice in the taller glass takes much less time to drink from. (Carey 1974)
+ (judge by size; don't consider density change) popped popcorns weights more than the kernel which it is made from
+ (infinity related) Weight of a clay ball doesn't change if a tiny small piece of clay is added to it
+ (inifinity related) Identically shaped clay ball weighs more than play dough ball; yet when they are split into half...infinite looping the split...half of 8-9 years olds would think at one point the clay ball is gonna weight same as the play dough--weighs nothing at all. (Smith, Wiser and Carey)
+ (mutual intrution of weight and density) After learned the distinction of 2 materials (steel and aluminum), kids (under 8, or even older) think a small light steel will make a paper bridge collapse--considering substance density over object weight! Falsifies the claim that kids don't know about density at all (although they gotta confound the two and judge density based on weight).
+ (confusion in weight and density) After "self-discovered" that smaller steel cube balances a larger alumnimum cube because of its made of "heavier kind of stuff", kids then think two balls of same intermediate size, one steel and one alumnimum, should also weigh the same "because they weigh the same before" (i.e. Using substance density instead of weight). That leads to contradiction.

**agree with adults**
+ Kids (as young as 3-5) are able to (not guaranteed) reason when sugar dissolves into water, its substance-level properties remain (e.g still tastes sweet; weight enough to collapse a paper bridge). (Au 1993, in contrary to Piaget's experiment where the questions are less intuitively shown) => They do know that substance-level conservation even when the object has changed.
Or. Able to have a "substance" theory, i.e. Some materials have some innate property. And maybe also, substances are homogeneous.
--Haven't explained: "iron is heavier than cotton"; 

+ Kids (as young as 3) are able to distinguish weight and size and know to measure that (they know they need to hold a thing to weigh it rather than just look at the size of it, when are asked about weight related questions). (C. Smith et al 1985)
** contradiction to the 'vertical-is-more' phenomena **, where no density change yet kids still judge differently! WHY?

**concepts in history of science**
+ Greeks don't think mass is a necessary entity of matter: air can have no weight but only levity
+ Weight is not an extensive quantity; it's relative: different substances use different weight units.
+ Density doesn't add up to weight? People talk about specific gravity which compares mass/unit volume relative to water.

Max Jammer 1961

> I think: thinking in conservation requires a dynamical change perspective (compare this moment vs next moment); or, you can look at things as distinct events, make measurements and judgements separately and don't consider their relation.

### Why does that concept work? In what scenarios is it correct?
### What is a prototype underlying that theory? (A more basic theory...and probably another set of CS1 and CS2)

## When does CS1 transform to CS2? What has happened?
### Historically how did the concept change?
### Developmentally when?
