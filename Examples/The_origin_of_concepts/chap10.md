Examples:
+ "Hot": degree of heat -> temperature and heat
+ "Fast": speed -> instantaneous and average velocity
+ "Heavy": -> mass and density

Research questions:
+ What is CS1 and CS2 (i.e. Old and new theory)?
    + What are their relation? (Here: (un)differentiated concepts)
+ how to characterize CS1 (a theory that we no longer use)?
    + What language do they use? What contexts do they use those concepts?
    + Do they have some terms that we (in CS2) never use?
    + Why does that concept work? In what scenarios is it correct?
    + What is a prototype underlying that theory? (A more basic theory...and probably another set of CS1 and CS2)
+ When does CS1 transform to CS2? What has happened?
    + Historically how did the concept change?
    + Developmentally when?

# theory of weight
##  whatis cs1 and cs2?

Cs2: mass equals density times volume; mass is an extensive quantity while density is extensive.

Cs1 seemed to assume that volume dictates mass? Let's look closer

(Their relation: undifferentiated concept of density and weight? Or just lack of conservation?)

## characterize cs1?
### Language they use?
Relative description of "heaviness".

### Do they have some terms that we (in CS2) never use?
    
Eg: unit of different matters are different.

The same thing weighs differently for different people.
### Why does that concept work? In what scenarios is it correct?
### What is a prototype underlying that theory? (A more basic theory...and probably another set of CS1 and CS2)

## When does CS1 transform to CS2? What has happened?
### Historically how did the concept change?
### Developmentally when?
