by David Badre from Brown (pretty well structured neural talk)

## real example of cognitive control
"indoor voice" vs "outdoor voice" -- but children are incapable of controlling themselves indoor!
``` seems to me it's assuming kids know what they "should do", yet cannot do it. very "classroom-oriented" way of thinking. do we have to control? how important it is? is there any other like motivational factors interferring with this? ```
### what is hierarchical control? 
...missed it

## when do cognitive control fail?
### patients
frontal lobe dysfunction => failed control

## experimental paradigm
hierarchical: stimuli can be grouped by either color or shape. need to first identify which domain is your cue, then response accordingly

## what's the mechanism?
### on the level of neural network (layers and units), how to implement?
key: the learning and response are two seperate network: sensory motor/ contextual / schematic control. 
+ neural evidence? different regions

## more than cortex: relation with basal ganglia?
### computational problem?
gating working memory to solve the *flexible v.s. stability dilemma*
you need to first decide what to pay attention to, then 
### neural support for the hypothesis?
-loops betw striatum and mortor cortices can both inhibite and activate the motor plan
### conceptual check: bring back to the previous task
illustrative process for solving that task
### neural check: experimental prediction?
