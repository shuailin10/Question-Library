## real example of cognitive control
"indoor voice" vs "outdoor voice" -- but children are incapable of controlling themselves indoor!
``` seems to me it's assuming kids know what they "should do", yet cannot do it. very "classroom-oriented" way of thinking. do we have to control? how important it is? is there any other like motivational factors interferring with this? 
### what is hierarchical control?
...missed it

## when do cognitive control fail?
### patients
frontal lobe dysfunction => failed control

## experimental paradigm
hierarchical: stimuli can be grouped by either color or shape. need to first identify which domain is your cue, then response accordingly
