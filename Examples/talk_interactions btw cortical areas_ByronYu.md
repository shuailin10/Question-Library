key question:
considering the communication of 2 areas (V1 and V2 here): what info is not transmitted to the higher level info? 
//here we are assuming forward-feeding info...what if V2 also drives V1? 


Q: how does this dimension reduction relate with stimuli?
A: studying kinda diff question if we care about fluctuation between trials (more like noise) rather than the mean response across the trials (=>more like response to stimuli) 

Q: what is driving this low-dim manifold in V2?
-is it V1 itself is low-dim?
-is it smaller # of neuron in V1 that are not connected to V2 at all?
(they try to argue: it's bc V1 is keeping some fluctuation info to itself)
