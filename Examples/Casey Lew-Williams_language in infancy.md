# basic arguments
how human different from machine?
- propensity for communicating with others
- detecting and remembering structure

# social communication drives learning
speech ABA violation of AAB rule: infants look; if it's music tones, however, infants don't show that detection.
However! If show 30s videos of people communicating in tones, infants start to pay attention to patterns of tones!!
*yet, the group diff is so small*

## multimodal effect
sequence of touch in natural scenarios...affect infants' learning! *interesting aspect to look into: naturalistic touches*
sign language...in communicative VS non-communicative scenarios.
(confound: facial expression? in non communicative scene people seem to be less happy)

# neural coupling during communication
q1: who take the lead? infants lead the adults or vice versa?
q2: at what moments does the coupling happen?
q3: confoudning: is it bc of communication? is it just both attending to the same thing (i.e. viewing same video)?

# statistical learning in natural sentences
stimuli? 2min natural speech. 
variable? detect specific words statstics (e.g. some adj+n always go together; some syllabus always go together).

However, not repetition of words is always picked up. number of speaker matters (the more the merrier?)

How do you talk to the kids affect their vocabulary? At age 1, more repetition the bigger volcabulary; age 2, less rep the better.

# beyond detecting statistical abnormali: what else does that affect?
- reaction to "point to la petela/el zapato" (gender difference is picked up fast and used to make distinctions)
- learn a novel word: should predict first( look at the familiar thing) then shift attention to the new thing after making mistakes.
