# culture, information theory and the brain
big ques: where does new theory/model come from? how do people adapt their theory with reality?

## theory1: when/how do you ask question i.e. optimal info collection?
notnonly maximize EIG --mutual information, but also consider penalty if you make mistake: d_{min}. # not so sure how's it defined
Eg: search query for Google is not increased with the amount of total possible webpage [low fidelity regime]

## theory2: KL divergence...(surprise)
-as attention indicator 
-indicates aethestic
-paper BoW model evolution (rate of how much language has changed). conclusion: 2 year/3 year novelty has decreased over the years.
compared with fan fiction: how much people are seeking for novelty or they like to repeat themselves?

> why? why something is able to spur popularity, why sth novel dies out? (I was asking a much finer grained question I guess?) All these characterization is retrospective and not predictive

-process model...adding forking process into the theory?
