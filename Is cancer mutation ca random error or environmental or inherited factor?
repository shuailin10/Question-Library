Q1 If it's because of random error during replication, what should we see?
Q1.1 compare cancer rate in different tissues, and tissue cells' reproduction property?
A-More times of stem cell division, more likely to have cancer

Q2 How to estimate the proportion of each kind of mutation?
-Heredity: just see correlation of familial mutation
-Environment: just see correlation of same env(same area? same life habbit? there're so many ways to characterize that)
-Replication: correlation of tissue / age? 
---not really correlation, but percentage of variance it can explain...like, weight in linear model? then there's cross term as well, how to account for that?
